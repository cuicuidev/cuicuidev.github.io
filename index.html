                    <p>
                        I am a psychology graduate currently changing my career trajectory towards data science. During my college studies I had a few of my first 
                        experiences dealing with data analytics, and I recall it was what I enjoyed the most during that time. Now, as of the last two years, I've been building a solid foundation in 
                        data science. The more I learned, the more I liked what I was doing, so much so that I started dipping my toes deeper into programming and took a liking for software development as well. <br><br>
                        A few months ago, I enrolled in a data science bootcamp by Hackaboss that I've recently finished. There, I could further reinforce my foundations and get experience working on 
                        bigger projects that the ones I was accostumed to when learning by myself. <br><br>
                        As of today, I am a very proficient in deep learning, machine learning, data analysis and visualization. I have a deep understanding of many of the programming principles and software design.
                        I am very passionate about working with data, as I believe it is the most essential resource in any business. Everything in life can be described by a function, 
                        and I especially love the idea of using data to reverse engeneer any function so that we can leverage the power of prediction.

                                <p>
                                    This is an idea I had a while ago. I'm a regular gym goer and I thought it would be convinient to have a mobile app that allowed me to track my progress 
                                    and visualize it. This is exactly that.<br><br>
                                    I am using Django as my back-end, PostgreSQL as my database and Gunicorn along with Nginx as my server. Everything is 
                                    containerized with Docker. This API allows crud operations on gym tracking entries and JSON Web Token authentication methods with RS512 encription. There is also CI/CD pipelines in place 
                                    that check dev and production environments setup.<br><br>
                                    The front-end is not yet created, although I'm planning on using Flutter for the mobile app and tackle with a new JS framework to showcase the product on the Internet.<br><br>
                                    I've got to admit, this is my most ambitious project so far and not even the back-end is ready for deployment. I fear I might have taken a task too big for one person to acomplish. 
                                    However, I want to take on the challenge and learn from the experience.<br><br>
                                    Even if this is an unfinished project, I want to showcase it here regardless, so that you can always take a sneak peek and see what I am capable of!

                                        Leveraging the computing power of GPUs, I've managed to train a deep neural network that can classify a car image and predict it's manufacturer.
