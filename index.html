                    <p>
                        As a child I've always been fascinated by computers and technology. In my early teenage years I was first introduced to programming when trying to 
                        figure out how videogames are made. Since then, I've been learning new technologies all my life until today.<br><br>
                        My biggest commitment to programming happened in early 2022, when I finally discovered my passion, data science. I began reinforcing my statistics fundamentals, dedicated myself completely to learning the 
                        ins and outs of Python, and then enrolled in a Data Science bootcamp at Hackaboss. Over 6 months I've been investing as much as 40 hours each week learning everything that was thrown at 
                        me during the bootcamp. Also I tackled some other areas of development in Python, such as back-end with Django and game-dev with PyGame. Also, I've spent some time complementing my back-end 
                        learning with front-end development using vanilla js, html and css, as well as mobile cross-platform development with Flutter and Dart.<br><br>
                        Now that I finally feel ready, I'm seeking my first job opportunity in the IT sector. I'm eager to work in any field I've been studying so far, as well as to broaden my horizons and aquiere expertise in new technologies. 
                        As a mostly self-taught developer, I believe I posses the skillset necessary to achieve anything I set myself up to.

                            <h3>My Gym Bro</h3>
                            <p>
                                This is an idea I had a while ago. I'm a regular gym goer and I thought it would be convinient to have a mobile app that allowed me to track my progress 
                                and visualize it. This is exactly that.<br><br>
                                I am using Django as my back-end, PostgreSQL as my database and Gunicorn along with Nginx as my server. Everything is 
                                containerized with Docker. This API allows crud operations on gym tracking entries and JSON Web Token authentication methods with RS512 encription. There is also CI/CD pipelines in place 
                                that check dev and production environments setup.<br><br>
                                The front-end is not yet created, although I'm planning on using Flutter for the mobile app and tackle with a new JS framework to showcase the product on the Internet.<br><br>
                                I've got to admit, this is my most ambitious project so far and not even the back-end is ready for deployment. I fear I might have taken a task too big for one person to acomplish. 
                                However, I want to take on the challenge and learn from the experience.<br><br>
                                Even if this is an unfinished project, I want to showcase it here regardless, so that you can always take a sneak peek and see what I am capable of!
